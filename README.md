# AirConditionalSystem
In view of the current cost of energy, checking unnecessary expenses or factors that increase energy consumption is extremely important. An equipment that can increase energy consumption is the air conditioner unit, but at the same time it is almost a basic need for regions, such as southern Brazil, during summers with temperatures above 35 Â°C.  Some factors can potentiate the exaggerated consumption of energy by the air conditioners. Among the factors, we can mention doors and windows open in the environment being refrigerated, and this causes the thermal balance generated to take time to happen or even not to happen. This means that the desired temperature for the environment is not reached by the air conditioner unit and it never turns off the condenser unit.  Given the above, this work aims to develop an application based on sensors and a microcontroller device that allows only to connect/keep an air conditioner unit on, controlling the power supply, when there are no open doors and windows.  This system consists of a Raspberry Pi Pico controller, a supervisory application for Linux and a supervisory application for Android. All the main programming was done in C++ with object orientation.
